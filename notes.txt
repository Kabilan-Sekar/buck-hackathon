ASYNCHRONOUS BUCK CONVERTER DESIGN AND ANALYSIS USING CURRENT-MODE CONTROL
1. Introduction
This project focuses on the design, simulation, and analysis of a digitally controlled buck converter implemented in MATLAB Simulink. The objective is to achieve regulated 12 V output from a 24 V input supply using current-mode control and to evaluate performance under both steady-state and transient conditions. The project also includes component selection, PCB design, load transient and small signal simulation in KICAD AND MATLAB SIMULINK respectively

3. Step 1 — Design and Simulation (MATLAB Simulink)
3.1 Simulation Model Overview
The system is modeled in MATLAB Simulink, consisting of the following main subsystems:
•	Power Stage:
Includes a MOSFET as the main switch, a Schottky diode as the freewheeling path, a 400 µH output inductor, and a 100 µF output capacitor.
•	Control Stage:
Implements current-mode control with an inner current loop and outer voltage loop. A current sensing block measures the inductor current and compares it with the reference derived from the voltage error amplifier. For comparison, a digital PID controller is also implemented by discretizing the converter model using a sampling period of 5 microseconds.
•	Load Transient Simulation:
A signal-controlled variable resistor is used to emulate load transients. The load resistance is made sinusoidal to evaluate transient recovery and control loop stability.

3.2 Steady-State and Dynamic Results
•	Output voltage: 12 V regulated at nominal load
•	Inductor current ripple: Approximately 3 of average load current
•	Output voltage ripple: Less than 50 mV peak-to-peak
•	Transient response: Settling time below 1.5 ms for 50% load step
•	Efficiency: Above 90% at full load with minimal switching losses
The transient performance confirms that the converter maintains stability and quick recovery under dynamic load variations. The steady-state response shows negligible deviation in output voltage, indicating good control design.

3.3 Small-Signal and Frequency Response
The converter is linearized around the steady-state operating point using MATLAB’s control design tools. The resulting Bode plot confirms adequate stability margins:
•	Phase Margin: Approximately 50 degrees
•	Gain Margin: Above 10 dB
These results validate the effectiveness of the compensator design and ensure robust control under parameter variations.

5. Step 3 — Thermal Simulation
A preliminary thermal analysis was performed using SolidWorks Simulation. The PCB model was imported with realistic component power losses based on switching and conduction characteristics.
•	Ambient temperature: 25°C
•	Steady-state thermal analysis: Conducted under full-load operation

6. Step 4 — Digital PID Control Implementation
A digital PID controller was implemented to compare with the analog current-mode loop. The gains were tuned to achieve a critically damped response while minimizing steady-state error.
Control Mode	Overshoot	Settling Time	Steady-State Error	Stability
Current-Mode	Low	Fast	Negligible	Excellent
Digital PID	Moderate	Slightly slower	Zero	Stable
Both methods achieved stable regulation, with current-mode control offering faster dynamic response, while the digital PID provided flexibility and easier parameter adjustment in the discrete domain.
